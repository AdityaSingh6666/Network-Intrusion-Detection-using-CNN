## ü©ª Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure you have your trained model

Place your trained CNN model in the following path:

```
models/cnn_nids_model.keras
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will launch in your browser, allowing you to upload or input data for real-time network intrusion detection.
